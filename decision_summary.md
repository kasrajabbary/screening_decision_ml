# Executive Decision Summary  
### Screening Outreach Under Capacity Constraints

---

## Purpose

This analysis supports **screening outreach decisions** under real-world constraints such as limited capacity, fixed budgets, and accountability to value-based care incentives.

The goal is not to predict risk, but to determine **who should be contacted**, **how many**, and **what we expect to gain** from outreach.

---

## Decision Context

- Eligible population is large
- Outreach capacity is limited
- Resources must be allocated efficiently
- Over-contacting wastes resources
- Under-contacting misses preventable disease

As a result, **threshold selection is a policy decision**, not a modeling one.

---

## Approach

1. Rank eligible members by screening risk
2. Evaluate outreach at different capacity levels (C)
3. Estimate expected yield and cost per outcome
4. Assess potential impact using conservative causal framing

Models are used as **ranking tools**, not decision-makers.

---

## Key Findings (Illustrative)

- Yield increases rapidly at low capacity, then plateaus
- Marginal benefit decreases as outreach expands
- PPV varies substantially by threshold choice
- Small changes in capacity can materially change outcomes

These patterns emphasize the importance of **explicit cutoff decisions**.

---

## Implications for Leadership

This framework enables leadership to:

- Choose outreach size based on expected return
- Understand tradeoffs between reach and yield
- Justify decisions to regulators and payers
- Align screening strategy with value-based incentives

---

## Key Takeaway

> **The primary decision is not which model to use,  
> but where to draw the outreach line.**

This framework makes that decision explicit, measurable, and defensible.
